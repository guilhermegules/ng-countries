## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] See all countries from the API on the homepage
- [x] Search for a country using an `input` field
- [x] Filter countries by region
- [x] Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- [x] Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- [] Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
